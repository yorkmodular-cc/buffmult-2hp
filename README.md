## 2HP buffered multiple
A 2HP iteration of my buffered multiple module - updated so that it's considerably smaller back-to-back (39mm, exc. power cable), making it more suitable for skiff-style cases.

No fancy normalling here, it's 1 input, 5 outputs in a slimline package.

The module has a panel fabricated from 1.6mm FR4 (aka PCB material). Power cable and mounting hardware are provided.

### Build notes

Nothing special - the build is 100% through-hole with a relatively small parts count.
